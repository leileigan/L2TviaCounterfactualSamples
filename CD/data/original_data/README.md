Logical Counterfactual Data (LCD) is the test set `test.json` and extracted label sentences `test.text`.

Note that in `test.json`, only the linearized logical form ('logic_str') and the label sentence is counterfactual. And the `logic_str` is not corresponding to `logic`, because only the linearized logical form is used during inference.
